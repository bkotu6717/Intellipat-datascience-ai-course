# Desriptive stats types

## Central Tendency:
  ```
  Mean: Average of all data in the set
  Mode: More frequent element in the set is called mode of the set
  Median: Middle of the data points, the set has to be arranged in ascending or descening order before finding the median
    - If N is even, then average of middle 2 elements is the median of the set
    - if N is odd, then the middle element is the median of the set
  ```
## Variation:
  ```
  Range: The difference between highest and lowest values in the set
  ```
  ```
  Percentile = ((The values that are less than the given values) / (total number of values)) x 100

  Percentile dvides the data into 100 parts
  ```
  ```
  Quartiles: Quartiles divides the data into 4 equal parts
  All the qurartiles are percentiles but all the percentiles are not quartiles
  ```
  ## percentile vs quartiles

  ```
  Inter Quartile Range(IQR):  Difference between lower and upper quartile
  range = Q4 - Q1
  ```

  ```
  Standard variance: measures how far a set of numbers are spread from a mean value
  ```

  ```
  Standard Deviation: exact magnitude by which each point has spread out
  standard deviation = squart root of (standard variance)
  ```

  ```
  Correlation: is a term that measures the linear relationship between two variables
  Range of correlation: -1 to +1
  Negative correlation: -1 to 0
  No correlation: 0
  Positive correlation: 0 to 1
  ```

  ```
  Hypothesis testing and estimation: TBD
  ```

  # Probability

  > Defines the likelyhood of occurance of an event occurs
