# Desriptive stats types



## Central Tendency:
  ```
  Mean: Average of all data in the set
  Mode: More frequent element in the set is called mode of the set
  Median: Middle of the data points, the set has to be arranged in ascending or descening order before finding the median
    - If N is even, then average of middle 2 elements is the median of the set
    - if N is odd, then the middle element is the median of the set
  ```
## Variation:
  ```
  Range: The difference between highest and lowest values in the set
  ```
  ```
  Percentile = ((The values that are less than the given values) / (total number of values)) x 100

  Percentile dvides the data into 100 parts
  ```
  ```
  Quartiles: Quartiles divides the data into 4 equal parts
  All the qurartiles are percentiles but all the percentiles are not quartiles
  ```

  ```
  Inter Quartile Range(IQR):  Difference between lower and upper quartile
  range = Q4 - Q1
  ```
